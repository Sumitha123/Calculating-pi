# Calculating-pi
We are simulating dart throws virtually by calling a dart_throw function.

Total number of dart throws required is taken as input from the console and is passed as argument to the dart_throw function.

Dart_throw function returns the total number of darts in the quadrant of circle with radius 1.

Pi is calculated using the formula :
Total darts in the quadrant/area of square circumscribing the quadrant = ((PI.r2)/4)/(1)
